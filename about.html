        <h1> Aloha! </h1>
        <p>I'm a healthcare professional with a background in clinical laboratory science. I have collaborated with cross-functional teams to develop strategies to make routine operations quicker and simpler for employees, resulting in reduced lab errors and improved patient care. I was immediately excited when I learned about UX/UI design because it would allow me to brainstorm solution-focused strategies and ignite my creative side through design.</p>

           <p>My solution-driven and creative personality have motivated me to obtain my UX/UI design certification from the University of Denver. I want to work for a company that holds great company values and offers a service that has a quality impact on people.</p>
            
            <p>I am confident that I will offer you the grit and zest that you are seeking in a UX/UI designer.</p>
